<h1>Anusha Gurijala acts in a play</h1>
<h3>Hedda Gabler by Henrik Ibsen</h3>

<h4 class="name MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h4>

<p class="speech">Yes, Hedda, here I am, in mourning and forlorn; for now my poor sister
has at last found peace.</p>


<h4 class="name HEDDA">HEDDA.</h4>

<p class="speech">I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.</p>


<h4 class="name MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h4>

<p class="speech">Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to
Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of
death.</p>


<h4 class="name HEDDA">HEDDA.</h4>

<p class="speech">That was very kind of you.</p>


<h4 class="name MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h4>

<p class="speech ">Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for
Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.</p>


<h4 class="name HEDDA">HEDDA.</h4>

<p class="direction">[Changing the subject.]</p>
<p class="speech"> She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss
Tesman?</p>


<h4 class="name MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h4>

<p class="speech">Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he
not come home yet?</p>


<h4 class="name HEDDA">HEDDA.</h4>

<p class="speech">No. He wrote that he might be detained. But won't you sit down?</p>
