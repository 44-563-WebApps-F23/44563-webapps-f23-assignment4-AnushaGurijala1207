<h3>Hedda Gabler by Henrik Ibsen</h3>

<h4>MISS TESMAN.</h4>

<p>Yes, Hedda, here I am, in mourning and forlorn; for now my poor sister
has at last found peace.</p>


<h4>HEDDA.</h4>

<p>I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.</p>


<h4>MISS TESMAN.</h4>

<p>Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to
Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of
death.</p>


<h4>HEDDA.</h4>

<p>That was very kind of you.</p>


<h4>MISS TESMAN.</h4>

<p>Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for
Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.</p>


<h4>HEDDA.</h4>

<p>[Changing the subject.]</p>
<p> She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss
Tesman?</p>


<h4>MISS TESMAN.</h4>

<p>Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he
not come home yet?</p>


<h4>HEDDA.</h4>

<p>No. He wrote that he might be detained. But won't you sit down?</p>
