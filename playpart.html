<h1>Anusha Gurijala acts in a play</h1>
<h3>Hedda Gabler by Henrik Ibsen</h3>
<div>MISS TESMAN.</div>

<div>Yes, Hedda, here I am, in mourning and forlorn; for now my poor sister
has at last found peace.</div>


<div>HEDDA.</div>

<div>I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.</div>


<div>MISS TESMAN.</div>

<div>Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to
Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of
death.</div>


<div>HEDDA.</div>

<div>That was very kind of you.</div>


<div>MISS TESMAN.</div>

<div>Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for
Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.</div>


<div>HEDDA.</div>

<div>[Changing the subject.] She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss
Tesman?</div>


<div>MISS TESMAN.</div>

<div>Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he
not come home yet?</div>


<div>HEDDA.</div>

<div>No. He wrote that he might be detained. But won't you sit down?</div>


<div>MISS TESMAN.</div>

<div>No thank you, my dear, dear Hedda. I should like to, but I have so much
to do. I must prepare my dear one for her rest as well as I can. She
shall go to her grave looking her best.</div>


<div>HEDDA.</div>

<div>Can I not help you in any way?</div>


<div>MISS TESMAN.</div>

<div>Oh, you must not think of it! Hedda Tesman must have no hand in such
mournful work. Nor let her thought dwell on it either--not at this time.</div>


<div>HEDDA.</div>

<div>One is not always mistress of one's thoughts--</div>
<div>MISS TESMAN.</div>

<div>[Continuing.] Ah yes, it is the way of the world. At home we shall be
sewing a shroud; and here there will soon be sewing too, I suppose--but
of another sort, thank God!</div>
  <div>GEORGE TESMAN enters by the hall door.</div>
