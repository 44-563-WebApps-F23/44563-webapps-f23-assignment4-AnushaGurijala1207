        <h3>Hedda Gabler by Henrik Ibsen</h3>
<h4 class="name MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h4>

<p class="speech">No thank you, my dear, dear Hedda. I should like to, but I have so much
to do. I must prepare my dear one for her rest as well as I can. She
shall go to her grave looking her best.</p>


<h4 class="name HEDDA">HEDDA.</h4>

<p class="speech">Can I not help you in any way?</p>


<h4 class="name MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h4>

<p class="speech">Oh, you must not think of it! Hedda Tesman must have no hand in such
mournful work. Nor let her thought dwell on it either--not at this time.</p>
